I'm **Petar “PeterSvP” Petrov** — an indie game developer and the CEO of Pi-Dev Bulgaria, where I work as the lead developer and designer 🎮. I'm known online as **PeterSvP**, and I'm an avid gamer who turned into a game designer after spending my late teens and early adult years working on a range of different things and learning what I wanted to build 🛠️.

My main creative focus as of now is video games. I'm working on [**ColorBlend FX: Desaturation**](https://colorblendfx.com) 🌈 — a 2.5D puzzle-platformer metroidvania with a strong emphasis on puzzle-driven progression and color-splattering gameplay. I've led the project and collaborated with composer [Iliyan "**DarksSilencer**" Kateliev](https://www.youtube.com/darkssilencer), voice actors [Christofer White](https://www.instagram.com/chrisxct3) and *Martina T.*, and our media partners [TDB Play Bulgaria](https://tdbplay.com/) (*OOOYeti*, *Demonichorn*, *SScorpid* & others) as well as **my *great* friends** [**Mitko8009**](https://github.com/mitko8009) (QA) and [**Pumzow**](https://pumzow.com) (art + game design), who supported me far beyond the credits and helped carry me through my own personal *Desaturation*. **SUPPORT INDIE DEVS ❤️**

My second bigger project is [**Chessocracy**](https://chessocracy.com) ♟️🃏 — a real-time multiplayer strategy game where chess-inspired units fight across dynamic terrain, with additional card-driven abilities and RTS-style control. It's both my next game, and a project used to develop reusable systems, tools and multiplayer technology that will carry into future projects.


### 🚀 What I do
- 🎲 **Game dev** (Unity, gameplay systems, tools, world/level systems)
- 🧠 **Networking & server architecture** (authoritative/relay, scalable game loops)
- 🛠️ **Developer tooling** (pipelines, editors, automation, utilities)
- 🎨 **Indie production** (design + implementation + shipping)

### 🧰 Selected projects & repos

- [**PiDevUtils**](https://github.com/Pi-Dev/PiDevUtils) — my main open-source toolbox: a shared foundation of reusable C# utilities for Unity, general game-dev, Editor tooling (including in-editor spreadsheet, auto-completion widget, serializable stuff), Audio, Management (Singletons, Object pooler) & other stuff I use in my projects.

- [**SoundFlow**](https://github.com/Pi-Dev/SoundFlow) — adaptive audio framework for Unity focused on real-time playback control: layering and sequencing, runtime mixing behavior, and building responsive music/sound systems that react cleanly to gameplay.
- [**PiGameServerFramework**](https://github.com/Pi-Dev/PiGameServerFramework) — a lightweight C# multiplayer server framework built for fast iteration: easy message routing/handling, room/session management, and a clean base for both relay-style and authoritative game logic, usable for prototypes and live games. This powers **Chessocracy**.
- [**TikTokLiveTool**](https://github.com/petersvp/TikTokLiveTool) — real-time TikTok LIVE monitoring / integration tool for game mods and interactive applications.
